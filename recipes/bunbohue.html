        <h2 class="header">What is Bun Bo Hue?</h2>
        <p>Bun Bo Hue is a beef noodle soup from Vietnam. It consists of sliced beef, pork sausage, and sometimes pork knuckles. The dish comes from the city of Huế, a central Vietnamese city. The dish consists of spicy, salty, and umami flavors. I personally chose this dish because it is one of my favorite noodle soups.</p>

                <h3 class="header">Red Coloring and Aromatics</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sauté seeds in oil on medium heat until the seeds give up the bright red color, then remove the seeds.
                        </li>

                        <li>Add shallots and garlic, sauté until brown.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add all of this to the pot of broth for color.

                    <ol>
                        <li>The easiest thing to do is just buy it already cooked and boil just to heat it up. If you use the raw type like we did for this recipe, cut into 1″ cubes and boil for 30-45 minutes</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Prepare a bowl of about 2 cups of water, mixed with the juice of 1 lemon.</li>
                        <li>Thinly slice the banana flower and add to the water mixture to sit for about 30 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <img src="https://www.hungryhuy.com/wp-content/uploads/sliced-banana-flower-300x200@2x.jpg">
                        <li>Avoid adding little fronds (that look like mini bananas), removing them as you encounter them. They taste bitter!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <h3 class="header">Saté (Spicy Chile Condiment)</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Weigh out the dried Thai chiles, then soak in just enough warm water to cover the chiles for 20 minutes. Drain the water.</li>
                        <li>Add all sate ingredients to a pan on medium heat and stir continuously to brown, cook, and slightly reduce the chile paste, about 30-40 minutes. If at any point it becomes too dry, you can add more oil, up to 50% of the amount we started with. Taste and reseason with sugar or salt as desired. See photo for how the final product should look.</li>
                        <img src="https://www.hungryhuy.com/wp-content/uploads/sate-680x454.jpg">
                        <li>Let cool and transfer to a sealed jar stored in the fridge . You can add ~2 tbsp of the final product to the soup pot for a boost in flavor and color, or simply and let each person add to their bowl to make it as spicy as they'd like!</li>
