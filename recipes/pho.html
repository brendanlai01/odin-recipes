        <h2 class="header">What is Pho?</h2>
        <p>Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup consisting of broth, rice noodles, herbs, and meat. Pho is a popular food in Vietnam where it is served in households, street stalls and restaurants countrywide. It is Vietnam's national dish. I chose this dish because you most likely have heard of this dish. It's a delicious and flavorful noodle soup and one of my favorite comfort foods. </p>

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>

                <li>Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</li>
                <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water. Let soak for 1 hour. Drain.</li>

                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute. Drain.</li>
                <li>Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Ladle hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
